<h3>How do I approach designing software?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>One design skill that I learned better in this project is making methods more modular. There are certain things that we had to set with materials, textures, and positions that were much easier to set through functions. That way the actual rendering code was simpler and easier to implement for each object. I would take a list of requirements and ensure that I included each one. I simply went down the list and worked on one thing at a time. This allows me to stay focused on the most important current issue I am trying to fix. I will use this method in future development by creating a list of development items to be done.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How do I approach developing programs?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>One new strategy I used while developing was to move down the list of requirements and tasks systematically. This way I could include all the needed functionality to the program. Additionally, I tried to make it all modular. This allowed me to use functions to assign each object certain values. That way I didn't have to write the same code every time I rendered a new object.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Although I may not always develop 3D renderings in my educational or professional path, I believe I will use the modular ideas of code in all my projects. I think that every software project needs code that is modular and reusable. It makes the code run faster and more efficiently. Additionally, it will be much easier to read.</li>
</ul>
